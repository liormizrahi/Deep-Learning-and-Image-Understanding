# Deep-Learning-and-Image-Understanding
This repository contains the advanced assignments of the course "Deep Learning and Image Understanding" at Reichman University (formerly IDC) teached by Yacov Hel-Or (toky).

This course introduces the basic concepts and tools for image understanding using Deep Learning.

Topics that were covered during the course:
  General architectures of Neural Networks (NN), 
  Convolutional NN architectures and other recently proposed networks, 
  Recurrent NN, 
  Generative adversarial models 
  and the implementation of the learned concepts for common Computer Vision tasks, such as object detection, object localization, scenesegmentation, face recognition.
